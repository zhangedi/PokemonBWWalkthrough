<h1>Welcome to the Walkthrough of Pokemon Black and Pokemon White's tutorial.</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the project</h2>

looking robes holding a crown. He is approaching a throne as other elderly men watch. A younger man with green hair approaches the throne before closing his eyes.
The scene changes to show an image of the younger green haired man as a child, with 3 Pokemon. A Darmanitan, which is a large red Gorilla Pokemon; a Zorua, which is a small black fox Pokemon; and and Woobat, which is a small, fluffy bat Pokemon.
