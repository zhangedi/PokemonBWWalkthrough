<h1>Welcome to the Walkthrough of Pokemon Black and Pokemon White created for blind players.</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the project</h2>
<p>
    This walkthrough will cover starting the game through Accumula Town.
    The goal is to help players navigate through the towns more quickly by giving instructions on how many times to click each directional button as well as provide descriptive text to each scene so players know what is happening on the screen.
