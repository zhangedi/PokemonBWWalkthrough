<h1>Welcome to the Walkthrough of Pokemon Black and Pokemon White created for blind players.</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the project</h2>
<p>
    This walkthrough will cover Pokemon Black and White gameplay from starting the game through Accumula Town.
    The goal is to help players navigate through the towns more quickly by giving instructions on how many times to click each directional button as well as provide descriptive text to each scene so players know what is happening on the screen.
    If you are a blind Pokemon player you may also want to consider the Pokemon Access mod.
    <a>https://github.com/nuive/pokemon-access</a>
    It works for generations 1-3 of Pokemon.
</p>

<h2> Setting up the game</h2>
<p>Before entering gameplay, you will be selecting your gender, inputting your name, and be introduced some characters and cutscenes.
    If you do not care about these things, keep clicking the "A" button until you hear the music shift to a slow piano like melody.
    Then, skip to heading 2, "Gameplay" of this website.

<h3>Intro Cutscene</h3>
<p>The intro cutscene has minor spoilers. You can click start or the A button at any point in the cutscene to skip the cutscene.
The cutscene starts as the camera zooms into a castle. From there the scene transitions to a man with long green hear wearing somewhat royal and religious
looking robes holding a crown. He is approaching a throne as other elderly men watch. A younger man with green hair approaches the throne before closing his eyes.
The scene changes to show an image of the younger green haired man as a child, with 3 Pokemon. A Darmanitan, which is a large red Gorilla Pokemon; a Zorua, which is a small black fox Pokemon; and and Woobat, which is a small, fluffy bat Pokemon.
The scene returns to the two adult men with green hair. The older one is lowering a crown onto the younger one's head.
Once you hear the music change to the familar Pokemon theme, the scene has changed to showcase gameplay.
